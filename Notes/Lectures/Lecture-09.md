These are lecture notes from June 4th...

###### Table Of Contents
1. [Science and its Publics]()

#### Science and its Publics
Misunderstanding the mistrust... legitamite none technical critiques get lost in noise of ignorant wales.

- Mad-cow desis
   - Government in the UK assumed people did not trust the scientists because they did not understand the science
   - In reality people felt the scientists were too close to the argicultural industry which biased the results ( which turns out was true )
- GMOs
   - societey lascks trust with GMO foods not because they dont understand the science but because large profit oriented coperations which rule the industry have done some really shaddy less than respectable work in the past... Monsanto!
- HIV and AIDS
   - Its not that people dont believe HIV leads to AIDS, as shown with science, it is that they refuse the price hicks that come with it because of big pharma
   
--> Govenerments trying to (re)instill trust between societey snf science during the 1960s - 1970s // Counter Enlightment comes back!

###### Crisis of Legitamacy
Huge drop in trust in scientific research and findings
- PUST: Public understanding of Science and Technology
   - Uses the deficit model ( missing knowledge === irrational fear )
   - assumes more knowledge === more acceptance w/ no potential rejections
   - over looks non-technical critiques
- PEST: Public engagment w/ Sci and Tech
   - Must have a way to allow for non-technical critiques
   - policy making must involve the public
   
> Why is the government so concerned?

science is the foundation of our economic growth model, without trust there's a risk of everything crumbling

#### Do we need technology policies?
**They already exist!!** Should be made/put in place using forward thinking and not scrapping them together after the fact like is currently happening in NA

4 areas policise are required for a thriving tech sector:
1. Climat Settings
   - Examples: { Copy Right System, Education System, Taxation, Subsities, ... }
   - > *Over tone is to provide benifits to everyone but come at a cost too greate for any individual to bare*
2. Survery Global Data and Trends
   - Market and practices across the world
   - required for globalization by a country
3. Coordinating
   - colaboration accross disciplines
   - insentives varies players
   - Ex: Large infrastructure projects --> telecommunication networks
4. Gap Filling
   - Government gets involved in development
   - Ex: Orphan Drugs ( drugs which help a very small number of people it doesnt make finacial sense to produce ) Gov't steps in to produce drug...
   
###### Technology Assesment Paradigms
1. "Ad hoc" Policy making
   - Throughing together laws after the fact with little study or consideration
   - informalal approach, no rules for approaching the subject // non-systematic
   - used in NA for policy making
2. Classical T.A.P
   - PUST framework against definition of valuation
3. OTA - Office of Technology Assesment
   - Have scientists and engineers do first hand research on new tech
   - determine valuated results from new tech
   - include stake holders testamony in the report // problem who are stake holders?
