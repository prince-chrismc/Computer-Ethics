###### Post-Human Future
_What are the potential gains or losses in terms of humanity?_

Is AI Possible?
Depends what you believe. If you believe in a soul, cartesian ego than you can doubt the possibility of AI. If you completely reject those ideas and see what is called the human experience ( intelligence and consiousness ) as an emergant property of the complex system of synapz and electro-chemical reactions of the brain, than it is conviable that once we understand our brains we can replicate it within a machine. In this AI mindset humans are just a complex machine.

Some definitions/explinations
- cartesian ego (I think there for I am), believe there's a part of you which is who you are
- emergant properties ( whole is greater than the sum of its parts ), certain characteristics can exists which belong to the body and not to any one individual part // bees in a swarm

Acccording to AI specialist, Inteligence is prevention of preprogramming --> the whole is not greater than its parts, this is a deflationary point of view of an Ego making humans not so special meaning machines would contain the properties which we use to seperate humans from other life forms.

Most liekly future is IA ( inteligence amplification ) having a black box which we dont need to understand the complexity which gives us access to a wealth of instant knowldge which can be grown. How much more pesabile than AI ?
