#### Technilogical Singularity
Singularity comes from physics...
> point beyond which known laws break down passing into the _unknown_

Fear of expontential growth. once we become smart enough to make something smarter it will be smart enough to make something smarter which will be smart enough to...

###### Post-Human Future
_What are the potential gains or losses in terms of humanity?_

Is AI Possible?
Depends what you believe. If you believe in a soul, cartesian ego than you can doubt the possibility of AI. If you completely reject those ideas and see what is called the human experience ( intelligence and consiousness ) as an emergant property of the complex system of synapz and electro-chemical reactions of the brain, than it is conviable that once we understand our brains we can replicate it within a machine. In this AI mindset humans are just a complex machine.

Some definitions/explinations
- cartesian ego (I think there for I am), believe there's a part of you which is who you are
- emergant properties ( whole is greater than the sum of its parts ), certain characteristics can exists which belong to the body and not to any one individual part // bees in a swarm

Acccording to AI specialist, Inteligence is prevention of preprogramming --> the whole is not greater than its parts, this is a deflationary point of view of an Ego making humans not so special meaning machines would contain the properties which we use to seperate humans from other life forms.

Most liekly future is IA ( inteligence amplification ) having a black box which we dont need to understand the complexity which gives us access to a wealth of instant knowldge which can be grown. How much more pesabile than AI ? 

#### Displacement of Jobs by Technology
Unemployment during the Great Depression ~25%. Future techonologies will create massive unemployment; leaders in Silicon Valley trying to build preventative measures.

Historical Analysis:
1. First Industrial Revolution:
   - New technologies allowing for the mechanization of work increased production at far more efficient rates.
   - Producing a greater surplus while decreasing the demand for employees.
   - employees === consumers ... leaving no consumers to buy surplus
   - Marx's social revolution didnt happen. capitalism adapted by creating new industries which sparked new jobs.
2. Computer Revolution
   - introduction of computers in the workplace --> new industries
3. AI Revolution ( pending )
   - potential for ~45% _unemployable_ far greater scale
   - radically different from previous revolutions... humans will no longer be required.
   - general purpose robots
   - autonomos robots replacing transportation industry (70m jobs)
   - ["humans need not apply"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)

Universal Basic Income:
* Every human is garanteed a basic income sufficient to survive
* what if everyone stops working? // post AI revolution they wont even be able to!
* cutting social benifits like welfare
* bring everyone above the porverty line
* to perserve _capitalism_
