#### What is Computer Ethics?
> What about computers was revolutionary for Ethics?
>
> A: Logical Maluablity

Conceptual/Policy Vaccum:
* Gap between capatiblities to human actions
   - intelectual property theft
   
Conceptual: unclear from moral point of view ( MZ's comment to congress )
Policy: Lack of laws

Computer ethics aims to fill the  vaccums
Invisibility Factors
1. Abuse - "Hacking"; Ex: Penny Skimming / transaction
2. Programming Values - AI's White Guy Problem
3. Complex Computation - Was math executes as planned?

#### Theories of morality
1. Utilitrainism
2. Deontrology
3. Social Contract

###### Utilitrainism
1. Consequentalism: Only the outcome of an action matters when evaluating morality
2. Hedonism: Only pleasure/displeasure of the outcome of an action matters when evaluating morality
3. Agregate: From the POV of a disinterested benevolent spectator

> JS Mills Quote

Critiques:
1. Counter intuative "the ends always justify the means"
2. Ignores distribution of happiness

###### Deontology
* Consequences don't matter - means do
* Duties/Rights base analysis

> Humans have rights because they are rationalize decisions
- Categorical Imperative: 
1. Formula of the Universal Law ( FUL )
   - "Always act in such a way that the maxim implicit in your act is fit to be a Universal Law"
   - maxim: general rule followed by everyone
   - Testing acts:
      1. Find the maxim implicit from the action
      2. Imagine a world where everyone acts according to that maxim
      3. moral = ( original act is no longer possible ) ? false : true
2. Form of End inself ( FEI )
   - "Always act in such a way that you treat people as ends in themselves and not as mere means"
   - Person concents to the action
   
Critiques:
1. Exclulsivity "We give rights to objects outside the scope of rational"
2. Counter Intuative ( for reason above i.e. killing baby)

###### Social Contract
- Justice for Fairness by Rawls
- "From the original position, entering a society with any trait(s), could you accept the policy?"
- original position: POV from before or outside society --> veil of ignorance "screen of morally arbitrary parts of yourself" only your rationality ( idea by Kant )
- Testins policy:
   1. Imagine yourself not yet born or time traveling
   2. entering a society with the traits ( or without depending on the policy ) in question.
   3.  moral = would you remain in this society?
