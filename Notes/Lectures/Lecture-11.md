###### Neo-liberalism
Economical and political policies to protect individual rights, humans rights have to be respected.

 Free Trade is the best way to obtain all individuals rights being upheld. government constrants or interventions are thus against human rights.
 
 Liberalism has a conatation for forcing views onto people, ie military intervention of UK in india before decolonization. UK claimed it was to bring democratic rule for the people.
 
 Neo-liberalism:
 * "Encourage economic freedom"
 * **free trade** capitalism.
 * policies that are pro private industry
 * market should rule everything
 * government structures ate too limiting to market for individual rights.
 
 > genuinly wants to improve the basis of human rights through elevating the quantity of free market trade
 
Against or counter to neo-lib we have Alter-Globalization
- **Fair trade** capitalism
- see too much private interest as widdening the socio-economic gap
- maintain a level of justice as fairness

Non-technical critique of Neo-Lib:
Posative and getive human rights
- Negaive rights: "freedom from interferience"
- Positive rights: "freedom to aide"
   - very difficult to define but easy to find examples

Complaint is that Neo-Lib _only_ looks at Negative rights and ignores positive rights.
