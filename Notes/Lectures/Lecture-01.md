#### Is Computer Science a Science?
Args from reading:
- Math
- [ Study of ] what can be automated
- Used by other sciences ( Bad Arg )

#### Definition of a Sceince
> Study of laws of natures 
> * Perform Experiments: i.e. the Scientific Method by Francis Bacon
>
> Would Comp Sci be better suited under the same umbrella as { Math, Engeering, Art }
> * Because it is applient on man made constructs

Profs Args for this being a science, the `metaphysical status` of information: we give **value** to things

Science can go as far to show `idea === !flase` but this is different from `idea != false || idea == true`

Some parts of Comp Sci do follow the scientific method { Software Design } but this is constrasted by bad predictability of research

Returning to metaphysical status --> value ... imples technology has value
> **Normativity**: Technology is evaluated === "how ought to be"

#### Can We Define Technology?
Author proposes the *narrative of technology*
> 1. Intentions
> 2. Artifacts
> 3. Desired Outcome

Implication:
- a technology is more than just an object
- can not be value neutral
  - how and why we use it makes it evaluted to { good, bad }
- How/Why we use it changes the technology

Simple example from reading + class:
- rock on the floor ( artifact )
- car keys locked in car ( Context )
- unlock car ( intention + outcome )
- smash window with rock to get keys ( technology )
  
#### Social Construction of Technology
Technological Determinism:
* Tech shaps society ( Hard ) Karl Marks: "**Forces** society to change"
* Tech influences society ( Soft ) "guides change" + "technological momentum" society can push back until tech becomes encompassing
* All the way down "there are reasons of Techs shape at it's core" _vague_
* Co-Constructivism "they shape each other over time"

#### Does Technology Mean Progress?
Notitions of progress:
* Enlightment [ 1600s - 1700s ]
   - Context: birth of science; loss of authority by church / monarch ( divine rule ); Economic model; inequality;
   - Concept: Empowerment; Tool for liberation; instrumental value / means to an endl;
* Technocratic: [ < 1950s ]
   - Context: Industrial revolution; military technology ( improving quality of life ); 
   - Concept: Inherient value; manifest destiny "tech fated to improve lives" / "towards desirable social progress";
* Counter Enlightment [ 1960s - 1980s ]
   - Context: Cold war; nuclear power; enviromental mouvement; hippie mouvement;
   - Concept: "Not all tech is good" 

> For us today, *does technology mean progress?* 
Answer: Depends towards what... "What kind of societey do we want to live within?" --> **Democracy**
