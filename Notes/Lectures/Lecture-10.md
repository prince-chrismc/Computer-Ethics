#### Internet's Own Boy
The point of this place was to watch the documentary "The internets's own boy: Aaron Swatz" from 2014 to provide a concrete example behind the subject of the reading

Key points to extract from film
- SOPA + PIPA
- Threat to the "Architecture of the internet"
- Creatative Commons

! This didnt go well for me talking notes...


###### SOPA - Stop Online Piracy Act
- US companies have very little power over international sites breaking US laws.
- This law proposed "restricting access to site that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content"
- This is done by requiring google search engines ( ie google ), advertisers ( facebook ), and ISP to withhold service to these _restricted sites_
- Example: would not be able to transfer funds from PayPal to restriceted server
- Puts every website at risk to be flagged since it only requires "facilitation" of copyright infringement

> The bill requires every payment or advertising network operator to set up a process through which outside parties can notify the company that one of its customers is an "Internet site is dedicated to theft of U.S. property." Once a network gets a notification, it is required to cut off services to the target site within five days.

###### PIPA - Protected IP (Intelectual Property) Act
Exact same as SOPA with a different title LOL

###### Threat to the Architecture of the internet
> Effects on critical Internet architecture - Technical experts testified that the proposed DNS measures conflicted with the fundamental basis of the Internet and would "break" ongoing attempts to make the net more secure against malicious use.

> Implementing such a solution breaks the distributed tree of authority concept used by the DNS by “injecting” U.S. nationalized pieces of DNS policy into the system. ISPs around the United States would become responsible for implementing, maintaining and monitoring these SOPA feeds into their DNS infrastructures, creating an additional layer of operational complexity for their DNS operations. Additionally, since not all DNS systems permit the inclusion of external data feeds to support local policy, many operators would be required to upgrade the recursive DNS infrastructures in significant ways.

> Savvy users could simply bypass a SOPA-enabled recursive DNS server by pointing their DNS settings to an off-shore recursive DNS server. Technically savvy networks might respond by blocking port 53 externally or by hijacking port 53 traffic on their network to their SOPA-enabled recursive DNS resolvers. Anyone want to bring Net Neutrality into this discussion?
